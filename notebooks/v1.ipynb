      "If you need any hints or clarifications about the problem, feel free to ask! Remember, you have 45 minutes in total, so make sure to manage your time effectively. Would you like some guidance on how to approach the problem?\n",
      "AI:  Your current implementation looks good! You've used a two-pointer approach, which is efficient for this problem. Here's a quick breakdown of what you've done:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Two Pointers**: You set up two pointers, `i` starting from the beginning of the array and `j` from the end. This is a common technique for problems involving in-place modification of arrays.\n",

      "2. **Swapping**: When you encounter an element equal to `val`, you swap it with the element at `j`, effectively moving unwanted elements to the end of the array.\n",

      "\n",

      "### Feedback:\n",
      "- **Problem-Solving Approach**: You've correctly identified an efficient method to solve the problem using a two-pointer technique.\n",
      "- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: The time complexity of your solution is O(n) because you traverse the list once. The space complexity is O(1), as you're modifying the array in place.\n",
      "- **Code Quality**: Your code is clean, but make sure to include necessary imports, such as `from typing import List`, if you're using type hints.\n",
      "- **Efficiency in Implementation**: You seem to have implemented the logic correctly. Just ensure you handle edge cases, such as when `nums` is empty.\n",
      "- **Communication**: You've been providing clear code, which is great. If you can explain your thought process as you code, it would further demonstrate your understanding.\n",
      "- **Time Management**: You're still within the time limit! Make sure to review your code once more before submitting to catch any potential errors.\n",

      "If you're ready to submit your solution, please type 'submit.' Otherwise, let me know if you have any questions or want to make improvements!\n",
      "AI:  It looks like you've reached the end of the time limit. Let's evaluate your final submission based on the dimensions you provided:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evaluation of Submission:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Problem-Solving Approach**:\n",
      "   - You used a two-pointer technique effectively, which is a solid approach for this type of problem. Your logic for swapping elements is appropriate for the requirement to remove occurrences in-place.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Algorithmic Efficiency**:\n",
      "   - Your solution operates with a time complexity of O(n), which is optimal for this problem since you must examine each element of the array at least once. The space complexity is O(1) due to in-place modifications, which is also excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Code Quality**:\n",
      "   - The code is relatively clean. However, it would benefit from including necessary imports (e.g., `from typing import List`) to make it functional in a standalone context. Additionally, proper formatting (consistent indentation and spacing) can enhance readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Efficiency in Implementation**:\n",
      "   - Your implementation is straightforward and follows best practices for this type of problem. Just ensure you handle edge cases, like an empty array or when all elements are the value to be removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Communication**:\n",
      "   - You provided clear code, which is great. It would have been beneficial to articulate your thought process while coding to demonstrate your understanding fully.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Time Management**:\n",
      "   - You effectively managed your time, reaching the submission at the end of the allotted period. It’s important to practice pacing yourself to leave room for reviews if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Adaptability**:\n",
      "   - You didn't request any hints or clarifications, which suggests confidence in your approach. However, if you had encountered difficulties, asking for guidance could demonstrate adaptability and a willingness to learn.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Overall Performance**:\n",
      "   - Overall, your approach to the problem is commendable, and your code logic is sound. Just focus on refining your communication and code quality in future interviews. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Final Thoughts:\n",
      "You have demonstrated a good understanding of the problem and an efficient way to solve it. With a bit more focus on code quality and communication, you could further improve your performance. Great job! \n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any questions or would like to discuss this further, feel free to ask!\n"
